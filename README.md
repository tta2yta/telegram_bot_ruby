[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-ruby.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

> The Ruby - ChatBot is a tool that helps user to boost their daily routine with some jokes and motivational phrases. The overall intentation is to help people to boost their productivity or change their mood status.

## Built With

- Ruby
- The Telegram Bot API

## How to Install
- First, you need to get a telegram account at [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org)
- Once you have an account, search for @BotFather, the Telegram bot-making wizard. This should open a chat with the BotFather.
- Now type '/newbot' and send to start a new bot and follow the instructions. The BotFather will ask you to choose a username and give you an API token. Keep this token secret. It can be used to control your bot.
- Fork this repo and clone to your local machine.
- Cd into the repo and create a file in the main directory called 'config.rb'
- Inside config.rb, type 'TELEGRAM_TOKEN_ID' and set it equal to the API token you got from the BotFather. Make sure the API token is in quotes to make it a string.

- Make sure you have Bundler installed in your machine. Once in the project folder (top level director), enter the command `bundle install` in your terminal. This will install the basic dependencies in the Gemfile.

- Now the rest of the app should run. Go to your terminal, cd into the 'bin' directory of the repo, and enter the command `ruby main.rb`.

- The bot should run. If you search for your bot by its username in Telegram, it should be ready to receive commands. 

- Currently, the bot responds to the commands 'start', 'jokes', 'quote', 'birthday','exchange' and 'stop'. 

- '/Start' will prompt the bot to give some basic info about itself.

- '/jokes' makes a joke about you.

- '/Quote' will prompt the bot to give a random inspirational quote.

- '/birthday' will prompt the bot to give a random birthday emoji.

- '/exchange' will prompt the bot to give a EUR exchange rate to CAD, USD, GBP, CHF.

- '/stop' will prompt with good by message.

- Of course, you can alter the messages and commands in ramsey_bot.rb to something you prefer.


## How to Run Tests

- If you ran `bundle install`, RSpec should be installed, along with all the other dependencies. To run the tests, cd into the top-level project folder and enter the command `rspec`. This will run all tests. It should be noted that the #make_request method is a private method, so its test will naturally fail. To make it pass, temporarily comment out the `private` keyword in the motivational_quotes.rb file. The tests should now pass. Once satisfied, uncomment it so that the #make_request method is private again.
